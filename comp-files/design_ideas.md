To design a blog theme that harmonizes with your cyberpunk Scottish thistle logo, hereâ€™s how I would describe the fonts and colors to a designer:

â¸»

ðŸŽ¨ Color Palette

Your logo uses neon tones on a dark background, evoking a cyberpunk aesthetic with Scottish flair. To carry that into the blog:

Base Colors
	â€¢	Midnight Navy (#0A0A1F) â€“ For the site background. Deep and neutral, it sets the tone without overpowering.
	â€¢	Thistle Blue (#00F0FF) â€“ For accents, headings, borders, or interactive elements like buttons and links.
	â€¢	Cyber Fuchsia (#FF2EC7) â€“ To emphasize active states (hover/selected), call-to-action elements, or highlights.
	â€¢	Electric Violet (#9A00FF) â€“ As a secondary accent, sparingly used for visual layering or section dividers.

Support Colors
	â€¢	Pale Neon Green (#72FFD8) â€“ Used lightly for success/status messages or hover glows.
	â€¢	Light Gray (#C9C9C9) â€“ For body text, contrast without being stark white.
	â€¢	Deep Charcoal (#121212) â€“ For cards or containers, creating subtle contrast on the dark base.

ðŸ”¤ Typography

Because youâ€™re neurodiverse (specifically dyslexic), and your brand reflects both pragmatism and personality, I recommend:

Headings
	â€¢	Font: Orbitron or Rajdhani
	â€¢	Style: Bold, wide letter spacing, tech-inspired geometry with a futuristic tone.
	â€¢	Color: Neon thistle gradients or solid thistle blue.

Body Text
	â€¢	Font: Atkinson Hyperlegible or Lexend Deca
	â€¢	Style: Clean, sans-serif, specifically designed for readability and neurodiversity.
	â€¢	Size: Base 18â€“20px, with generous line-height (1.6â€“1.8)
	â€¢	Color: Light gray or soft white (#E0E0E0) for high contrast without eye strain.

Code Blocks / Tech References
	â€¢	Font: Fira Code or JetBrains Mono
	â€¢	Style: Monospaced, minimal ligatures, cool-toned on dark panels.

ðŸ§± Design Vibe
	â€¢	Layout: Grid-based, modular, with motion effects (e.g. card rise-on-hover, animated SVG thistle on load).
	â€¢	Borders & Dividers: Use soft glow or subtle gradient lines (e.g. thistle-blue â†’ fuchsia fades).
	â€¢	Icons: Thin-line, minimal cyber-style (Lucide or Phosphor icons).
	â€¢	Buttons: Rounded corners (xlâ€“2xl), glassmorphism or soft glow hover states.
